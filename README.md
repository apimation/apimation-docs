# apimation-docs

## Apimation has two user interfaces:
1) Web interface: [Apimation.com](https://apimation.com)
2) Command line interface: [CLI client](https://github.com/dlocmelis/apimation-cli-client)

To use Command line client apimation team offers custom DSL based on YAML data structure: [YAML test asset creation](docs/yaml-tests.md)
- with cli you are able to use your own on-site test agents/nodes: [Test worker](docs/nodeInstaller.md)

## For both web and cli we offer:
- function call feature (data generation and manipulation functions): [Function call usage](docs/functionCalls.md)
